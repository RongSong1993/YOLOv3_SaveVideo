# YOLOv3_SaveVideo

   The original YOLOv3 version can be obtained from the website：https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/, but it does not save the output video which is detected by default.

   So, this project gives a complte project which can save you output,include your local test video and your webcam's test video. Only two files have been changed,include (./darknet/src/demo.c) and (./darknet/src/image.c). So,you can only change them in your YOLOv3 project.
  
Attention: 
   Beacause the （./darknet/yolov3.weights） takes up too much memory space,so this project doesn't include the model,you can download it in the website：https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/.
